<Card
	title="Why Free?"
	description="We believe that everyone should be able to have the same tooling to do
	investment research. By leveraging free API tiers, we can allow users to have
	access to a vast range of information for free. On the other hand, we want users
	that are willing to subscribe to premium API keys from certain data providers to
	be able to take advantage of that on OpenBB Terminal - this is where we see a
	monetization opportunity, a revenue share with data providers for connecting our
	users to their resources."
/>

<Card
	title="Why Open Source?"
	description="An open source product allows for higher quality, lower costs, more
	transparency, and faster go-to-market due to the strong community created. There
	is no point in re-inventing the wheel for financial theory that has been around
	for decades, thus users can adapt the platform to their needs or even build
	proprietary features on top of our infrastructure."
 />

 <Card
	title="Why Python?"
	description="Python is one of the most used programming languages due to its simplified
	syntax and shallow learning curve. On top of this, it is highly used in data
	science and academia world (particularly on finance, economics or business
	related degrees). This is very important, as it is the first time in history
	that users - regardless of their background - can so easily add features to an
	investment research platform."

### Obtaining support and giving feedback

Being an open source platform that wishes to tailor to the needs of any type of investor, we highly encourage anyone to share with us their experience and/or how we can further improve the OpenBB Terminal. This can be anything from a very small bug to a new feature to the implementation of a highly advanced Machine Learning model.

You are able to directly send us information about a bug or question/suggestion from inside the terminal by using the `support` command which is available everywhere in the terminal. Here you can select which command you want to report a bug, ask a question or make a suggestion on. When you press `ENTER` (‚èé), you are taken to the Support form which is automatically filled with your input. You are only required to include the type (e.g. bug, suggestion or question) and message in the form although this can also be set directly from inside the terminal (see `support -h`).
