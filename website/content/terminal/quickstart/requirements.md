Installation of the OpenbB Terminal requires downloading around 500mb of data. Querying data (by running commands) does not require a lot of bandwidth but you will certainly have a more pleasant experience if you will be on a fast internet line. 4G networks provide a good enough experience so if you're traveling your personal hot-spot will do. While it's technically possible to use a subset of the functionality in off-line mode, you will not be able to use any data that is queried from the APIs of data providers and services.

### Minimum System Requirements

- 4GB RAM or more
- 5GB free storage
